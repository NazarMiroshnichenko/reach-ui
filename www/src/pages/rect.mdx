# Rect

Calls back with the measurements of a dom node (aka. bounding client rect). See also [Element.getBoundingClientRect()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect)

```.jsx
<Rect>
  {({ rect, ref }) => (
    <div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(rect, null, 2)}</pre>
      <div
        ref={ref}
        contentEditable
        style={{
          display: 'inline-block',
          padding: 10,
          border: 'solid 1px'
        }}
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: "Edit this to change the size!" }
        }
      />
    </div>
  )}
</Rect>
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @reach/rect
# or
yarn add @reach/rect
```

And then import it:

```js
import Rect from "@reach/rect";
```

## Props

| Prop                   | Type   |
| -----------------------| ------ |
| [children](#children)  | func   |
| [observe](#observe)    | bool   |
| [onChange](#onchange)  | func   |

### children

*Type*: `func: ({ ref, rect }) => undefined`

A function that calls back to you with a `ref` to place on an element and the `rect` measurements of the dom node.


**Note**: On the first render `rect` will be `undefined` because we can't measure a node that has not yet been rendered. Make sure your code accounts for this.

### observe

*Type*: `bool` default `true`

Tells `Rect` to observe the position of the node or not. While observing, the `children` render prop may call back very quickly (especially while scrolling) so it can be important for performance to avoid observing when you don't need to.

This is typically used for elements that pop over other elements (like a dropdown menu), so you don't need to observe all the time, only when the popup is active.

Pass `true` to observe, `false` to ignore.

```.jsx
<Rect observe={false}>
  {({ rect, ref }) => (
    <div ref={ref}>
      <div>Will not measure the element when false</div>
      <div>Edit this code and change it to <code>true</code></div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(rect, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  )}
</Rect>
```

### onChange

*Type*: `func: (rect) => undefined`

Calls back whenever the `rect` of the element changes.

```jsx
<Rect onChange={rect => console.log(rect)}/>
  {({ rect, ref }) => (
    <div ref={ref}/>
  )}
</Rect>
```
